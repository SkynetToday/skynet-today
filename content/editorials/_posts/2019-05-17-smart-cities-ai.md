Smart cities [^definition] has been a frequent term in the media recently, with various controversies surrounding the use of sensors to collect data with negative implications, most notably in the use of [facial recognition to identify and fine jaywalkers](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/shaming-jaywalkers-china-facial-recognition-technology-privacy-11196684) in China.

[^definition]: Smart cities is a term used to describe cities which make use of Internet of Things sensors (usually incorporated in public infrastructure) and other data sources, to optimize city operations, such as traffic control, waste management, etc.

China's Smart Cities Surveilance
--------------------------------


Anti-terror Applications
------------------------
In the US, the most covered application of smart cities technology has been it's use in city-wide security measures. TO-DO: include more coverage on NYC use of surveilance

The [results of a recent study in the UK](https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/brits-demand-smart-city-anti-terror-measures-4201) showed that 39% of respondents supported the implementation of smart barrier solutions, which respond in real time to events or threats, such as terror-related attacks. 

Google's Sidewalk Labs

TO-DO add Sidwalk Labs coverage 

Smart Traffic Lights
--------------------
While the negativity around smart cities surveilance and data usage overwhelms its coverage in the media, not all usecases are as nefarious. The largest implementation of AI controlled adaptive traffic lights is in Hangzhou, with the [City Brain project led by Alibaba](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/15/tech/alibaba-city-brain-hangzhou/index.html). The project coordinates more than 1000 traffic signals through a cental platform 
A more localized approach to [adaptive traffic signal control](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/05/13/boston-traffic-lights-signals-quincy/) was installed at 20 intersections in Quincy, Massachusetts earlier this year. In this approach, each intersection is controlled seperately, with relevant data being communicated to downstream intersections. The results of the new traffic control system saw a reduction of queues by up to two-thirds. Similar systems have been installed in [Miami](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article215180285.html), [Pittsburgh](http://time.com/5502192/smart-traffic-lights-ai/), and in the [UK](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/22/smart-traffic-lights-always-turn-green-trialled-britains-roads/).
However, the decentralized approach is criticized by some as being "too local in scope" [^quote], with concerns that only citywide systems will be able to get the most benefit from computer controlled speed and directed lane changes when most cars on the road are autonomous

Smarter Public Transport
------------------------
While smart traffic lights trials have been at the forefront of smarter transportation, smart public transportation deserves some more attention. In 2018, [Citymapper launched its "smarter" bus service](https://citymapper.com/news/1800/introducing-the-citymapper-smartbus), running in central London, with plans to make it more adaptive to realtime demand. Citymapper's solution to city congestion is to evaluate and improve existing public transportation routes, and identify more efficient routes, with data of routes and realtime demand.


Where do we draw the line?
--------------------------
Collecting personal data, for marketing or 
The utupian dwelling that smart cities promise us is far in the future, but there are incremental positive changes that smart cities applications offer in the present. Optimizations to traffic, public transport, and improvements to infrastructure, with a forward look to integrating with connected vehicles in the near future, are all necessary changes for cities looking to keep up with growing populations and changing technological demands.
